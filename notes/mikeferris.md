# Mike's Notes 

Here are some areas that I have been thinking about and projects that I am interested in.

## Decentralization:
  How do we prevent centralization / cartelization within and across any of Ethereum's constituencies and power players? 
  (core developers / miners / stakers / etc / exchanges)
  One specific issue that concerns me here is Miner Extractable Value and the unfair benefits that large miners can gain from it.

## Governance:
  How do we ensure that the Ethereum community's voice is being heard regarding changes to the protocol?
  We can't assume that the loudest voices represent the interests of the majority. 
  Can we use ethereum for voting on changes to ethereum?

## User Experience: 
  A main ambition of Ethereum (and crypto in general) is to "bank the unbanked".
  Many of those unbanked people are just now gaining access to the internet/smart phones.
  If it's your first time being on the internet or using a smart phone, is the current Ethereum UX acceptable/understandable? 

## Inter-Chain Communication:
  Ethereum is just one of many blockchain platforms in existence. How can Ethereum exist in harmony with other platforms?
  Even if Ethereum continues to dominate the dApp space, we don't want dApps on other platforms to be inaccessable to users of Ethereum dApps.
  Having all different wallets and user experiences will not be condusive to adoption.
  In other words, how do we keep Web 3.0 from being fractured across platforms? 

## Rollups:
  How can large-scale rollups (100+ TPS) be kept secure? Rollup solutions seem quite necessary for scaling,
  but this post brings up flaws with Optimism:
