# Norswap's Notes

Hey, I'm Nicolas (aka Norswap). I have a blog at https://norswap.com and you can
learn more about me [there](https://norswap.com/about).

My main expertise is in compilers, but I have some background in distributed
systems.

I haven't decided what I want to be working on yet, but I'm open to proposals.

Feel free to pitch me your ideas, in particular if you would value the feedback
of someone with a strong CS background, but no specific crypto expertise.

You can reach me at norswap[at]gmail.com or @norswap on
Twitter / Facebook / Instagram / Telegram / Discord /...

I plan to go through the internship's material, and I will post about it here or
on my blog. If you want to see what my writing style look like, check out this
recent [blockchain introduction](https://norswap.com/blockchain-how/).
