# Dheeraj's Notes


## Project Ideas:
  - Asset transfers
  - zk-SNARKs


## 1. Asset transfers for Interoperability:
    There should be universal framework for asset bridges,
      - Any blockchain should be able to transfer assets to and fro from ethereum without implementing their own bridges.
    This is in my mind for a long time, there were many interoperability blockchains/protocols working on this problem. But I feel this should be incorporated into core ethereum.


## 2. zk-SNARKs:
     - I found this concept very interesting and has so much potential in solving new set of problems. But I am not quite sure about the specifics of integrating these concepts into ethereum.
     - I will update this space as I make progress.
